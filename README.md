# Agni's Empathy Builder

This is a standalone, single-file web application designed to help users develop empathy and "Theory of Mind" by analyzing complex social scenarios relevant to the Indian context.

## How it Works

The application presents users with various social, professional, and familial conflict scenarios. The user is asked to step into the shoes of the "other person" and articulate their perspective.

A local, rule-based analysis engine then scores the user's response based on:
1.  **Depth of Insight:** How well the user identifies the underlying fears, needs, and situational pressures of the other person.
2.  **Freedom from Bias:** Whether the user avoids judgmental or biased language.
3.  **Clarity:** The overall coherence of the response.

The application provides a score and constructive feedback to help the user improve their ability to "decenter" from their own perspective.

## Features

-   **Fully Offline:** Runs entirely in the browser with no external API calls or dependencies.
-   **Efficient & Fast:** Uses a local JavaScript-based engine for instant scoring and feedback.
-   **Rich Scenarios:** Includes a wide range of detailed scenarios across 15 different categories.
-   **Responsive Design:** Works on both desktop and mobile browsers.
-   **Filtering & Search:** Users can easily find scenarios by category, difficulty, or keywords.

## How to Run

No build process or server is required. Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
