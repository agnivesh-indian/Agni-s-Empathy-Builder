# Agni's Empathy Builder

This is a professional, standalone, single-file web application designed to help users develop empathy and "Theory of Mind" by analyzing complex social scenarios relevant to the Indian context.

## How it Works

The application presents users with various social, professional, and familial conflict scenarios. The user is asked to step into the shoes of a specific character in the scenario and articulate their perspective.

An advanced, local, rule-based analysis engine then scores the user's response based on:
1.  **Depth of Insight:** How well the user identifies the underlying fears, needs, and situational pressures of the character.
2.  **Freedom from Bias:** Whether the user avoids judgmental or biased language.
3.  **Clarity & Rationality:** The overall coherence and believability of the response from the character's point of view.

The application provides a detailed analysis with a score, a list of positives, and specific areas for improvement to help the user master the skill of "decentering."

## Features

-   **Fully Offline & Deployable:** Runs entirely in the browser with no external API calls, making it fast, private, and easy to host.
